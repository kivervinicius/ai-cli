# Final Security Report

Local security regression suite: PASS (`go test -race ./internal/core/security ./internal/control/web ./internal/control/registry`). Repository scan found no production secret values; test fixtures contain intentionally fake credentials and redaction cases. Git execution uses argument arrays, not shell interpolation.

Dedicated `semgrep`, `gitleaks`, `trivy`, `osv-scanner`, and `actionlint` are unavailable. Adversarial external deployment, cookie/browser, IDOR, and cross-platform filesystem tests were not executable here. PATH shims remain policy guards, not hostile-code sandbox isolation.
