# IAPro Nexus — Final Independent Validation

## 1. Audited SHA

- `AUDITED_FEATURE_SHA=c8747481fc04c65614b38b5c9d9da106f56858c3`
- Branch: `feat/nexus-maximum-delivery`
- Working tree: clean at audit start and end.
- Local SHA is one commit ahead of `origin/feat/nexus-maximum-delivery` (`6b5aff512195a0c6df4539e242fc7f632163b7a9`). No push was performed.

## 2. Main SHA and topology

- `MAIN_SHA=f71eb515278168e33d626fd631cd89dfb5e58faf`
- `MERGE_BASE=1899ca6334576d859056d48a394e51d03758f313`
- `AHEAD=67`, `BEHIND=1` (`git rev-list --left-right --count origin/main...HEAD`).
- The feature merged cleanly in a disposable worktree with `git merge --no-commit --no-ff`; no remote branch was modified.

## 3. Audit methodology

Followed `rules.md`, `maestro.md`, persistence contract, project `AGENTS.md`, DEV compact context, and engineering standards. Inspected implementation, tests, workflow YAML, release configuration, and ran local reproducible checks. No production code was corrected during this audit.

## 4. Previous findings classification

| Finding | Classification | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| F-01 Windows ConPTY/CreateProcessW | NOT_VERIFIABLE | No Windows runner available locally; no CI run exists for audited SHA (`gh run list ... c874748...` returned `[]`). |
| F-02 SessionHost failure race | NOT_VERIFIABLE | Linux targeted packages were exercised, but Windows/native same-SHA stress evidence is absent. |
| F-03 Windows SQLite lifecycle | NOT_VERIFIABLE | No Windows execution or file-unlock evidence. |
| F-04 cross-platform fixtures | NOT_VERIFIABLE | Linux-only local environment; native Windows/macOS jobs not present for SHA. |
| F-05 cancellation | NOT_VERIFIABLE | No complete same-SHA platform stress matrix. |
| F-06 hardcoded temporary paths | STILL_PRESENT | `/tmp` remains in production Unix-specific code and browser scripts; classification depends on path, but no cross-platform proof exists. |

## 5. New findings

- **P0 — updater does not consume/install a real archive safely.** `Service.Apply` extracts an archive into bytes, then `Updater.ApplyManifest` calls `ApplyUpdate`; `ApplyUpdate` writes those bytes directly to `BinaryPath`. There is no executable validation, fsync, health check, process restart, atomic platform-safe swap, or integrated rollback rehearsal. `internal/update/updater.go:38-119`, `internal/update/service.go:200-251`.
- **P0 — production trust root is unusable.** `internal/update/keyring.go:31-45` contains `REPLACE_WITH_GENERATED_HEX_PUBLIC_KEY`; initialization returns without a key, so default `NewKeyRing()` cannot validate an official release.
- **P1 — browser gates are not independent.** `web/package.json` maps `test:e2e`, `test:a11y`, and `test:visual` to the same `e2e-hardening-verify.mjs`, which performs functional and Axe assertions but no visual baseline comparison. CI marks each step `continue-on-error: true` and relies on a later aggregate assertion; this is weaker than three independent gate implementations.
- **P1 — CI contains broad failure tolerance.** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` uses `continue-on-error: true` for Windows, macOS, and browser steps. The aggregate assertions improve detection, but this design still permits diagnostics/artifact steps to continue and does not provide a successful same-SHA run for this candidate.
- **P1 — release artifact download is explicitly tolerated.** `.github/workflows/release.yml:169` has `gh run download ... nsis ... || true`; a later filename check covers one NSIS file, but the requested artifact contract and all native artifacts are not independently verified before attestation/publication.
- **P1 — streaming claim is false for large artifacts.** `downloadArtifact` uses `io.LimitReader` followed by `io.ReadAll`; this bounds memory to 256 MiB but still buffers the complete artifact and does not implement the requested streaming-to-temp-file/hash/fsync pipeline.
- **P1 — producer/consumer target contract is inconsistent/fragile.** The signer derives keys by stripping only `filepath.Ext`, while GoReleaser names archives with OS title and architecture conventions; the consumer constructs `runtime.GOOS_runtime.GOARCH`. No executed real manifest/artifact rehearsal proves equality for all targets.

## 6. Platform evidence

- Linux: local Go/frontend checks were run; no release-grade Linux package install rehearsal was completed in this audit.
- Windows: UNKNOWN — no native runner/evidence for audited SHA.
- macOS: UNKNOWN — no native runner/evidence for audited SHA.
- ConPTY, Wails native runtime, SQLite unlock, installers, and package smoke tests therefore cannot be marked PASS.

## 7. Browser evidence

UNKNOWN for the audited SHA. No local browser E2E run completed here, and no remote CI run exists for this SHA. The script requires `.nx-os-shell` before creating/opening a project, which conflicts with the stated fresh-install empty-project contract unless separately proven.

## 8. Desktop and distribution evidence

UNKNOWN: no native Wails Linux/Windows/macOS artifact was built and executed from this SHA; no DEB, RPM, or NSIS install/upgrade smoke was completed; no real macOS app or Windows installer artifact was consumed by the updater.

## 9. Updater trust and end-to-end evidence

Unit tests for `internal/update` passed in the available Linux run, but this is insufficient. The default trust root is a placeholder, and the production path writes extracted bytes as the executable without validating or executing the installed binary. No real GoReleaser artifact → signed manifest → updater → execute → rollback rehearsal exists.

## 10. Version/release evidence

- `VERSION` and `web/package.json` are `0.5.0-beta.23`.
- `go.mod` declares `go 1.25.0`; CI configures Go `1.25.14`.
- `goreleaser` was not installed in the audit environment, so `goreleaser check` and snapshot release are UNKNOWN.
- No release tag or published artifact for the audited SHA was created or inspected.

## 11. Security and hygiene

`git status --short` and `git diff --check` were clean. No tracked executable/build artifacts were found by the requested globs. `govulncheck` was not available as a standalone binary; the Make security command began dependency/tool resolution but did not produce a completed auditable result in this session. The placeholder trust root is itself a release-blocking security defect.

## 13. Remaining risks

Native Windows/macOS behavior, real browser flow, native desktop packaging, installer behavior, signed release production, updater archive installation, rollback, and same-SHA CI remain unproven. The updater trust root and archive installation defects are release-critical.

## 14. Verdict

# NO_GO_FOR_MERGE

The evidence is insufficient to claim that this exact SHA works, installs, updates, and recovers across supported platforms. The feature is not authorized for merge or release based on this audit.
