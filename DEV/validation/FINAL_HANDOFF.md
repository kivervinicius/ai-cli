# Final Handoff

Branch: `feat/nexus-maximum-delivery`. Verdict: `BLOCKED` for production delivery because governed automatic commit/push/PR is unavailable and the required remote CI/fresh-clone gates cannot be established. The local `package.json` change removing `--remote` was preserved.

Added autonomous local E2E startup, browser smoke, regression tests, cross-platform SessionHost/ConPTY fixes, and validation reports. All local Go/frontend quality gates passed. No main merge, production deploy, automatic commit, push, or destructive remote action occurred.
