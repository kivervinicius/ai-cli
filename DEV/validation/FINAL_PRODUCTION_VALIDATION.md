# IAPro Nexus — Final Production Validation

Verdict: CONDITIONAL_GO. Local source gates are green; external platform/provider/CI evidence is unavailable on this host.

Environment: Linux, Go 1.25.0, Node 22.17.0, Bun 1.4.0. Source ZIP SHA-256 verified as `26cb2c9928c19b852c835371dbace8ca47e1afc6f46a2a4ea022cb3993e2240d`.

Commands and results: `gofmt -l .` PASS (0); `go vet ./...` PASS (0); `go test ./...` PASS (0); `go test -race ./...` PASS (0); `go build ./cmd/nexus` PASS (0); `bun install --frozen-lockfile` PASS (0); `bun run typecheck`, `lint`, `test`, `build` PASS (0). Bundle JS/CSS hashes match between `web/dist` and embedded dist.

Corrections (commit `09bff6f221d9ba82e2d889f7bec2dfc4aac08cc6`): deterministic verifier shell, auth entropy injection, ephemeral test ports, parallel runner duplicate execution, schedule bind compatibility, and Bun executable/dependency contract. Regression evidence is in the final test suite.

Known external gaps: real provider session, macOS/Windows hosts, remote CI run, GoReleaser, and dedicated SAST/dependency scanners.
