# Final E2E Report

Verdict: `BLOCKED` for production delivery; local Direct Work evidence is conditional only.

- Go unit/integration and race tests: PASS.
- Frontend frozen install, typecheck, lint, tests (76/76), and build: PASS.
- Autonomous Nexus startup/bootstrap/cleanup: PASS on port 3001 with isolated temporary Git/data.
- Port 3000: canonical startup rerun PASS; no listener remained from this run.
- Real Codex provider runtime/output: PASS with exact-line `NEXUS_E2E_OK` marker and isolated copied profile.
- Playwright 10.9.2 and managed Chromium were installed locally; token-safe browser smoke completed with exit 0.
- Context handoff, Safe Apply reconnect, Mission real E2E, remediation, restart durability, and Take Control remain `NOT_TESTED`.
- No production secrets/tokens/cookies were written.
- Cross-platform fixes were added and compile-checked, but GitHub Actions could not be rerun for the uncommitted source. Real Mission/remediation/restart/takeover and cross-provider evidence remain NOT_TESTED.
