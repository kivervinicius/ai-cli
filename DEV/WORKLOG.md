# Worklog: IAPro Nexus Evolution & Project Alignment

## Date: 2026-08-30 (Workspace Host Layout Bugfix & Logo Asset Integration)
- **Workspace Layout Bugfix (`attention-layout.css`)**: Removed invalid 4-row `grid-template-rows` override (`var(--nx-topbar) auto minmax(0, 1fr) var(--nx-taskbar)`) that collapsed `.nx-workspace-host` to tab header height and pushed the taskbar up when `AttentionIntermediationBanner` was null. Preserved the standard 3-row OS grid (`var(--nx-topbar) minmax(0, 1fr) var(--nx-taskbar)`).
- **Repository Logo Integration**: Replaced placeholder "N" text marks with the real repository logo asset (`logo.png`) in `ProjectRail.tsx`, `ProjectHub.tsx`, and `NexusDemoApp.tsx` with `.nx-brand-mark-img` styling.
- **Verification**: `tsc` (0 errors), `eslint` (0 warnings), Vitest (26 files / 94 tests PASS), and web bundle rebuilt (`dist/bundle.js`).

- **Design Tokens Enhancement (`workspace-os.css`)**: Added `--nx-shadow-sm`, `--nx-shadow-md`, `--nx-shadow-lg`, `--nx-shadow-glow`, `--nx-transition-fast`, `--nx-transition-normal`, and `--nx-transition-slow` design tokens for both Dark and Light themes.
- **Header & Navigation Refinement**: Upgraded `.nx-topbar` with backdrop blur, increased element spacing (16px gap), improved command trigger hover, and smooth animated brand mark on hover.
- **Metric & Overview Cards Elevation**: Added subtle card elevation, hover translation (`translateY(-1px)` / `translateY(-2px)`), glow styling on icons, typography hierarchy enhancements on numbers (22px bold), and rounded agent mini list items with smooth transition states.
- **Action Buttons & Form Controls**: Added brand gradient backgrounds to primary buttons with glow box-shadow, tactile active states, improved default/secondary button visibility, and smoother focus transitions on inputs.
- **Workspace Tabs & Windowing**: Refined workspace stack headers with 10px radius, smoother tab bottom indicators, visible hover close buttons, and enhanced splitter indicators with accent glow.
- **OS Statusbar Zone Dividers**: Added subtle zone dividers and backdrop blur to `.nx-workspace-statusbar` with interactive branch button borders.
- **Verification**: `tsc` (0 errors), `eslint` (0 warnings), unit tests (26 test files / 94 tests PASS), and web production bundle rebuilt (`dist/bundle.js` 830.1kb).

## Date: 2026-08-30 (Directory Browser & PlanBuilder Null-Safety Bugfixes)
- **DirectoryBrowserModal & FS Browse**: Fixed empty modal issue by adding graceful fallback to CWD/Home in `handlers_fs.go` and `DirectoryBrowserModal.tsx`, robust bookmark/breadcrumb defaults, and explicit error card with retry button.
- **PlanBuilderSurface & ProjectManagerSurface Null-Safety**: Fixed unhandled `null.slice` and `.toLowerCase()` on `revisions`, `schedules`, `recentRuns`, and `project` search/sort fields.
- **Concurrent Provider Detection**: Parallelized driver detection in `handlers_api.go` (`handleProviders`) with `sync.WaitGroup` to eliminate sequential multi-second blocking on global data refreshes.
- **Verification**: `tsc` (0 errors), `eslint` (0 warnings), unit tests (76/76 PASS), end-to-end Playwright modal and workspace traversal tests PASS with 0 console errors.

## Date: 2026-08-30 (cross-platform validation)
- Reproduced and corrected the Windows-dependent provider JSON assertion: it now validates JSON schema and provider presence without requiring installed CLIs.
- Replaced host test reliance on Unix `cat` with the cross-platform `fakeagent` test binary.
- Moved SessionHost terminal writes outside the state mutex and synchronized stream-reader shutdown to prevent detector callback deadlocks/races.
- Added ConPTY process-exit monitoring so output reads unblock when the child exits.
- Verified Go/frontend full gates, 20x host throughput race regression, and Windows/macOS cross-compilation.
- Installed Chromium outside the repository and reran the token-safe browser smoke; production Mission/remote CI gates remain blocked/not tested.

## Date: 2026-08-30
- Added autonomous local E2E startup to `scripts/nexus-e2e-local.go`: temporary Git/data isolation, token-safe bootstrap capture, explicit `NOT_AUTHENTICATED` classification, cleanup, and Agent identity verification after refresh/reconnect.
- Added `scripts/nexus-browser-smoke.sh`, regression tests, and updated `DEV/validation` reports.
- Verification: Go tests/race/vet/build and frontend frozen install/typecheck/lint/test/build all PASS. Compiled real Codex E2E passed with exact-line `NEXUS_E2E_OK`; browser remains skipped because managed Chromium is unavailable.

## Date: 2026-08-30 (bugfix)
- **Fix: `Cannot read properties of null (reading 'slice')`** — backend can return `null` for `name` on `Project` and `Agent` objects despite TypeScript type declaring `string`. All avatar-initial expressions (`name.slice(0,2).toUpperCase()`) guarded with `(name || '').slice(0,2).toUpperCase()` across 6 files: `NexusShell.tsx`, `ProjectRail.tsx`, `ProjectManagerSurface.tsx` (card + list), `ProjectScanModal.tsx`, `ProjectOverviewSurface.tsx`, `AgentsSurface.tsx`.
- Verification: tsc 0 errors, ESLint 0 warnings, Vitest 76/76, bundle rebuilt (808.6kb).

## Date: 2026-08-29
- **Git Branch Switching & Management in Project Settings and Taskbar (`BranchSwitcherModal.tsx`, `WorkspaceTaskbar.tsx`, `ProjectManagerSurface.tsx`)**:
  - **Git REST Endpoints (`internal/control/web/handlers_nexus.go`)**: Implemented `GET /api/v1/projects/:id/git/branches` and `POST /api/v1/projects/:id/git/checkout` returning local/remote branch lists, working tree status (`is_clean`, uncommitted modifications count), and executing branch checkouts/creation safely while persisting changes to SQLite.
  - **Quick Branch Switcher Modal (`BranchSwitcherModal.tsx`)**: Created dedicated modal with branch search filtering, active branch indicators (`✓ Ativa`), repository cleanliness badge (`● Árvore limpa` / `● N alterações`), and new branch creation with 1-click checkout.
  - **Taskbar Footer Integration (`WorkspaceTaskbar.tsx`)**: Transformed the static footer branch item into an interactive button (`.nx-statusbar-btn`) that opens the `BranchSwitcherModal` from anywhere in the Workspace OS.
  - **Project Configuration Modal (`ProjectManagerSurface.tsx`)**: Replaced static text input with dynamic Git branch dropdown select, real-time working tree status badge, and direct "Fazer Checkout" button.
- **Orquestrador Maestro Discovery & Reconnection (`internal/nexus/maestro.go`)**:
  - **CLI Version Query & Dynamic Skills Catalog**: Updated `maestro.go` to discover the real `orquestrador-maestro` CLI version (`0.1.25`) and dynamically parse over 50 skills, quality gates (`dev-worklog-gate`, `tdd-verification`, `plan-approval`, `code-review`), and workflows from `~/.orquestrador/SKILLS_MANIFEST.json`.
  - **Engineering Advice Engine**: Connected `GetAdvice` to generate contextual engineering guidance based on project state and Maestro rules, removing the false `DEGRADED` status and marking Maestro as `AVAILABLE` (`ASSIST` mode).
- **Universal Provider Toolchain PATH & Auto-Update Fix (`internal/runtime/`, `adapters/`, `driver/`)**:
  - **EnhancedPATH Helper (`internal/runtime/runtime.go`)**: Built an intelligent PATH aggregator that automatically discovers and injects developer toolchains (`~/.nvm/versions/node/*/bin`, `~/.bun/bin`, `~/.cargo/bin`, `~/.local/share/pnpm`, `~/.local/bin`, `~/.fnm`, `~/.asdf`, `/usr/local/bin`, `/usr/bin`) and the provider binary parent directory.
  - **CLI Adapters Injection (`adapters/codex/`, `claude/`, `agy/`, `opencode/`, `gemini/`)**: Injected `EnhancedPATH` into all interactive provider execution environments, resolving the `No such file or directory (os error 2)` error during Codex/Claude auto-updates (`npm install -g @openai/codex`) and MCP server spawns.
  - **Workspace OS Drivers Injection (`internal/control/driver/`)**: Injected `EnhancedPATH` into all supervised runtime drivers (`codex_driver.go`, `claude_driver.go`, `agy_driver.go`, `opencode_driver.go`, `gemini_driver.go`), ensuring terminal sessions opened via the web UI have full access to host developer tools.
- **Release Manager Live Progress, Spinner & Atomic Installation (`internal/release/`)**:
  - **Live Animated Spinner & Elapsed Timer (`tui.go`)**: Added animated spinner (`⠋`, `⠙`, `⠹`...) and live execution timer during the `"building"` step so the user always has clear visual feedback and knows that the process is running automatically.
  - **4-Phase Status Tracking**: Displays status (`✓`, `⠋`, `○`, `✗`) for each of the 4 release steps: Web Frontend compilation, Go binary compilation with metadata LDFLAGS, atomic installation to `~/.local/bin/nexus` and alias `ai`, and binary validation.
  - **Bun Build Speedup (`release.go`)**: Added automatic detection of `bun` in `PATH` to run `bun run build` in ~200ms (with transparent fallback to `npm run build`), significantly accelerating release times.
  - **Atomic Binary Replacement (`copyFile` in `release.go` & `Makefile`)**: Switched to temporary file creation and atomic rename/move (`os.Rename` / `mv -f`) to prevent Linux kernel `ETXTBSY` ("text file busy") errors when installing a new binary while previous instances are running.
  - **Clear Exit & Status Guidance**: Explicitly displays completion summaries and instructions on when to exit (`Enter`, `q` or `Esc`).
- **Project Creation UI Unification (`AddProjectModal.tsx`)**:
  - **Unified Component**: Extracted and created `AddProjectModal.tsx` as the single source of truth for adding/creating local projects across the entire Nexus web app.
  - **OS Integration Everywhere**: Integrated `DirectoryBrowserModal` ("Procurar Pastas no SO…"), `ProjectScanModal` ("Escanear Projetos do Sistema…"), real-time live filesystem inspection (`/api/v1/fs/inspect`), Git branch detection badges, and tech stack badges directly into both the left lateral rail (`ProjectRail.tsx`) and the project manager workspace (`ProjectManagerSurface.tsx`).
  - **Eliminated Legacy Manual Form**: Removed the outdated, unintegrated `<Dialog>` and manual text fields from `ProjectRail.tsx`, standardizing the user experience everywhere.
- **Terminal Attention Detection, Push Notifications & Dynamic Titles**:
  - **Real-Time Stream Attention Detector (`internal/control/host/attention.go` & `host.go`)**: Built a high-performance heuristic parser and regex classifier that analyzes PTY terminal output chunks in real time, detecting interactive questions (`[y/N]`, option prompts, plan reviews), task completion milestones, active working states, and OSC window title escapes.
  - **Dynamic Contextual Titles & State Synchronization**: Automatically formats window and tab titles (e.g. `❓ [Project] Pergunta: <context>`, `✅ [Project] Concluído: <task>`, `⏳ [Project] <action>`), synchronizes them with the Registry, emits typed events, and pushes WebSocket frame updates (`"attention"`, `"title"`) to connected browser clients.
  - **Browser Push Notifications with Real Context (`web/src/notifications/PushNotificationManager.ts`)**: Integrated Web Notifications API with permission management, dispatching native OS push notifications with project name, event reason, and exact question or completed task summary, focusing the workspace window on click.
  - **Web Intermediation Banner (`web/src/components/AttentionIntermediationBanner.tsx`)**: Created a top alert banner with 1-click quick response buttons (`[Sim (y)]`, `[Não (n)]`), text response input, and terminal focusing, sending input directly to runtime stdin via `POST /api/v1/runtimes/:id/respond` or WebSocket.
  - **Workspace Dynamic Titles (`web/src/workspace/WorkspaceProvider.tsx` & `NexusWorkspaceApp.tsx`)**: Added `updateSurface` action to dynamically update tab headers and document titles (`document.title`) with real-time status indicators (❓, ✅, ⏳, ⚡).
- **Automated Version Bumping & Local Binary Installation (`Makefile`)**:
  - Configured `make build` (and `make`) to automatically increment the patch version in `VERSION` on every build (e.g. `0.4.4` -> `0.4.5`).
  - Embedded the updated version, git commit hash, and ISO UTC build timestamp into the binary metadata.
  - Automatically installs the compiled binary to the active profile's `~/.local/bin/nexus` and host `/home/desenvolvedor/.local/bin/nexus` with the `ai` symlink alias (`ln -sf nexus ai`), ensuring that local invocations immediately run the latest build.
- **Token Usage Scheduling & Codex Profile Isolation Fix**:
  - **Dominant Capacity Scoring (`internal/core/scheduler/scheduler.go`)**: Rebalanced the account selector so token availability across windows (`min(5h, weekly) * 0.7 + avg * 0.3`) is the dominant factor (scaled 0-1000 points). Scaled tier (+2.0) and default (+1.0) bonuses to act strictly as tie-breakers so accounts with less token usage (higher remaining capacity) always win selection.
  - **Codex Isolated Execution (`internal/core/provider/adapters/codex/codex.go`)**: Configured isolated `HOME`, `CODEX_HOME`, and `CODEX_CONFIG_DIR` environment variables in interactive execution and synced `auth.json` and `config.toml` between `$home` and `$home/.codex` so the Codex CLI always binds to the selected profile rather than the host home.
  - **Transparent Terminal Indicator (`internal/app/app.go`)**: Added startup notification banner indicating selected provider, profile name, account email, and bottleneck capacity percentage before launch.
  - **Verified**: 100% tests passing with `-race` across all Go packages. Confirmed automatic selection chooses `kivergmail` (Codex) and `kivervinicius-gmail` (AGY) due to 100% capacity.
- **Deep OS Integration for Project Management & Filesystem**:
  - **Visual OS Directory Browser (`DirectoryBrowserModal.tsx` & `/api/v1/fs/browse`)**: Built an interactive filesystem folder explorer with breadcrumb navigation, quick OS bookmarks (`Home ~`, `/projetos`, `Desktop`, `Documents`, `Root /`), tech framework detection badges (`Go`, `Node.js`, `Python`, `Rust`, `Docker`), and in-place directory creation (`/api/v1/fs/mkdir`).
  - **System Git Repository Auto-Scanner (`ProjectScanModal.tsx` & `/api/v1/fs/scan`)**: 1-click discovery scanning host development directories (`~`, `/projetos`, `~/workspace`, `~/dev`, `~/src`, `~/Desktop`) for Git repositories with branch detection and 1-click import.
  - **Real-Time Path Autocomplete & Live Inspection (`/api/v1/fs/inspect`)**: As paths are typed or picked, Nexus validates directory existence, branch name, and tech stack in real-time.
  - **Native OS Quick Launchers (`/api/v1/projects/:id/open-os`)**: Integrated 1-click actions on project cards and tables:
    - 📁 *Open in OS File Manager* (`xdg-open` / `open` / `explorer`)
    - 💻 *Open in Native Terminal* (`x-terminal-emulator` / `$TERMINAL`)
    - ⚡ *Open in VS Code / Cursor* (`code` / `cursor`)
  - **Comprehensive i18n & Verification**: 100% catalog parity in `ptBR`, `en`, and `es`. All 44 frontend Vitest tests and all Go `-race` tests passing. Rebuilt and installed `nexus` binary.
- **D-Bus Secret Service (`org.freedesktop.secrets`) Timeout Neutralization**:
  - Removed spurious wrapping of `dbus-run-session` in `internal/core/provider/adapters/agy/agy.go` that created empty D-Bus session buses and caused 120-second activation hangs.
  - Added headless keyring bypass environment variable `PYTHON_KEYRING_BACKEND=keyring.backends.null.Keyring` and sanitized `GNOME_KEYRING_CONTROL`, `GNOME_KEYRING_PID`, and `DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS` in AGY adapter and driver execution environments (`internal/control/driver/agy_driver.go`).
  - Validated 100% tests passing with `-race` across all Go packages and verified instantaneous execution in `nexus doctor`.
- **OS-Grade Project & Virtual Desktop Manager (`nexus://projects`)**:
  - **Mental Model Elevation**: Refactored project management into a true **Operating System Workspace & Virtual Desktop Manager** (similar to macOS Spaces/Mission Control and GNOME Workspaces) where each project anchors its own multi-window desktop, persistent agents, Git context, Maestro governance, and resource policies.
  - **Full OS Desktops Hub Surface (`ProjectManagerSurface.tsx`)**: Created dedicated full-featured surface with:
    - Top metrics cards (Total Desktops, Persistent Agents, Working Now, Maestro Mode).
    - Grid View featuring visual desktop cards with color-coded avatar, canonical path with 1-click copy, Git branch, Maestro mode, and live agent status badges.
    - Dense List View with sorting (Recently Active / MRU, Name A-Z, Most Agents) and search filter.
    - Embedded Project Configuration & Settings modal for editing project name, default branch, Maestro mode (`ASSIST`, `ORCHESTRATE`, `OFF`), isolation strategy, and resource policy (`BALANCED`, `PERFORMANCE`, `COST`) with instant SQLite persistence.
  - **Quick OS Switcher Overlay (`ProjectManagerModal.tsx`)**: Enhanced with arrow key keyboard navigation (<kbd>↑</kbd>, <kbd>↓</kbd>, <kbd>Enter</kbd>), search filtering, and direct link to open the full Desktops Hub.
  - **Dock / Project Rail Integration (`ProjectRail.tsx`)**: Added "All Workspaces / Desktops Hub" shortcut (`LayoutGrid` icon) in the global navigation section.
  - **Starter Project Templates (`ProjectHub.tsx`)**: Built first-run templates (*Fullstack SaaS*, *Microservice API with TDD*, *CLI Tool*) alongside custom repository folder import.
  - **i18n & Test Parity**: Updated translation catalogs in `en`, `ptBR`, and `es`. 100% tests passing across Go (`go test -race ./...`) and Frontend (44 Vitest tests). Built and installed `nexus` binary.
- **UX & Feature Refinement (Nexus Workspace OS & Maestro Integration)**:
  - **Eliminated Tab & Navigation Duplication**: Removed redundant sub-navigation strip and bottom duplicate tab buttons. Kept clean surface tabs at the top of workspace stacks.
  - **OS-Style Status Bar**: Refactored bottom bar into an OS Status Bar displaying Project name, Git branch, active working agents count, local connection status, and dual system versions (`Nexus v...` and `Maestro v...`).
  - **Prominent Language Switcher**: Added 1-click `LanguagePicker` directly in the Topbar header (`[🇧🇷 PT | 🇬🇧 EN | 🇪🇸 ES]`).
  - **OS-Style Project Manager Modal (`Ctrl+P`)**: Implemented project search, project switcher, overview shortcut, removal with confirmation, and local repository importer.
  - **Interactive Maestro Control Badge**: Clickable Maestro badge in Topbar opening a control modal with integration status, versions, assistance mode selector (`ASSIST`, `ORCHESTRATE`, `OFF`), active skills list, and direct link to Maestro workspace.
  - **Welcome Guide & Help Center (`?`)**: Added interactive Welcome Modal featuring product overview, 3-step quickstart, shortcuts & slash commands cheat sheet, installed version status, and interactive tour launcher.
  - **Dual Version Visibility**: Dynamic version endpoint (`GET /api/v1/system/updates`) provides live version information for both Nexus and Orquestrador Maestro across Topbar, Status Bar, and Welcome Guide.
  - **Full i18n Translation Parity**: Added comprehensive translations in Portuguese (BR), English, and Spanish for all new modals, labels, and features.
  - Recompiled binary (`nexus`), rebuilt web bundle (`web/dist`), verified visual layout via headless Chrome screenshots, and passed 100% Go and Frontend test suites.
- **Project Alignment, Modern Command Dispatch & Full Rebranding**:
  - Rebranded product to **IAPro Nexus** with canonical binary `nexus` (and `ai` symlink alias).
  - Renamed `cmd/ai/` -> `cmd/nexus/` with updated build targets in `Makefile` and `.goreleaser.yaml`.
  - Added direct root shortcuts for all modern commands: `nexus web`, `nexus start <provider>`, `nexus stop <id>`, `nexus ps` / `nexus running`, `nexus attach <id>`, `nexus handoff <id> <target>`, and `nexus continue <id> --with <provider>`.
  - Upgraded CLI help output (`nexus help`) to list all commands clearly categorized by Workspace OS, Agent runtimes, Profiles & Auth, Universal Sessions, and Diagnostics.
  - Implemented dynamic executable name detection (`progName()`) across all subcommands, usage errors, and completion generators.
  - Upgraded shell autocompletions for Bash, Zsh, Fish, and PowerShell (`nexus completion <shell>`) registering both `nexus` and `ai`.
  - Added support for `NEXUS_CONFIG_DIR`, `NEXUS_DATA_DIR`, `NEXUS_STATE_DIR`, and `NEXUS_REAL_HOME` with fallback to `AI_CLI_*` / `AI_MANAGER_*`.
  - Updated socket paths and pipes to `nexus-control-*` with fallback support.
  - Supported `/nexus` as the primary slash command prefix in supervised PTY terminals (with `/ai` alias).
  - Rebranded web frontend package to `iapro-nexus-web`, updated command hints, and rebuilt assets.
  - Updated `install.sh`, `install.ps1`, `uninstall.sh`, `README.md`, `README.en.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, and `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
  - All 43 frontend tests and all Go test packages passing (`go test -race ./...`).

## Date: 2026-08-28
- **Fix: Multi-Quota Awareness & Smart Capacity Selection**:
  - Identified that AGY maintains multiple quota windows (`five_hour`, `weekly`, `claude_five_hour`, `claude_weekly`).
  - Updated `internal/core/provider/adapters/agy/agy.go` to parse all 4 windows (`5h`, `weekly`, `claude_5h`, `claude_weekly`) into `UsageSnapshot.Windows`.
  - Updated `internal/core/quota/quota.go` `GetCachedUsage` to preserve and parse Claude quota windows from legacy `quota.json`.
  - Updated `internal/profile/usage.go` `GetQuotaDetails` to map `ClaudeFiveH` and `ClaudeWeek` windows.
  - Upgraded `internal/core/scheduler/scheduler.go`:
    - Implemented multi-window capacity scoring considering both the critical bottleneck (`minRemaining * 0.6`) and the average availability (`avgRemaining * 0.4`).
    - Scaled capacity score up to `+100.0` points so available tokens heavily drive profile choice.
    - Rebalanced default profile boost to `+5.0` points (strictly used as a tie-breaker on identical capacity rather than overriding accounts with higher availability).
  - Added test cases in `scheduler_test.go` (`TestMultiQuotaBottleneckSelection` and `TestDefaultProfileTieBreaker`).
  - 100% tests passing with `-race` across all packages.
- **Fix: Stdin Lease Injection & Out-of-Band RPC Refactoring**:
  - Replaced raw in-band JSON lease commands in `handler_terminal.go` with out-of-band RPC calls (`protocol.NewClient`).
  - Added defense-in-depth attached mode response suppression for non-interactive commands.
  - Rebuilt offline bundle (`bun run build`) and recompiled `ai` binary.

## Date: 2026-08-27
- **Architectural Refactoring**: Transformed the codebase into a modular local control plane for AI coding CLIs with clean package boundaries (`internal/core/{model,exitcode,security,config,quota,cooldown,classifier,scheduler,fallback,session,telemetry,provider}`).
- **Zero Fake Quotas**: Eliminated all fabricated 100% quota assumptions. Implemented honest usage states (`LIVE`, `CACHED`, `ESTIMATED`, `UNKNOWN`, `UNSUPPORTED`, `RATE_LIMITED`, `ERROR`) with TTL caching and freshness tracking.
- **Smart Account Selection**: Implemented multi-factor scoring selector with hard filters, LRU load-balancing for UNKNOWN states, project bindings, and `ai explain <provider>`.
- **Automatic Fallback & Cooldown**: Implemented cycle-safe retry mechanism with regex-based error classification and rate-limit tracking.
- **5 Providers Supported**: Added full support for Codex, AGY / Antigravity, Claude Code, OpenCode, and Gemini CLI with provider-native session resumption (e.g. `codex resume <id>`).
- **Security & Isolation Presets**: Built isolation policies (`strict`, `developer`, `compat`), secret redaction, and `ai security` audit command.
- **Universal Sessions & TUI**: Implemented cross-provider session index and professional Bubble Tea TUI.
- **Diagnostics & Testing**: Added `ai doctor`, `ai stats`, `ai history`, `ai config validate`, full unit tests passing with race detector and static analysis (`go test -race ./...`, `go vet ./...`).
- **TUI & Quota Enhancements**:
  - Restored quick numeric shortcuts (`1-9`), continue latest session (`c`), interactive quota details modal (`s`), smart resume choice modal (`r`), and official login trigger (`l`).
  - Fixed ANSI slicing visual glitch and aligned columns into a compact layout without box clipping.
  - Implemented legacy `quota.json` fallback in quota engine and provider adapters to display real cached quotas.
  - Fixed AGY authentication detection by scanning `antigravity-oauth-token`, keyring files, and quota files.
- **Documentation Restoration & Evolution**:
  - Restored the comprehensive Portuguese (`README.md`, default) and English (`README.en.md`) documentation files with sanitized examples.
  - Expanded both READMEs with complete guides for the 5 providers, Smart Account Selector (`ai explain`), Honest Quotas (`ai usage`), Universal Sessions, Workspace Bindings (`ai bind`), TUI, Architecture diagrams, and Shell autocompletions.
- **PowerShell Support**:
  - Implemented native `install.ps1` installer for Windows and PowerShell Core (`pwsh`).
  - Added native `ai completion powershell` and `ai completion pwsh` shell completer via `Register-ArgumentCompleter`.
  - Added unit test cases for PowerShell shell completions in `internal/app/app_test.go`.
  - Updated `README.md` and `README.en.md` with PowerShell installation and `$PROFILE` completion guides.
  - Pushed commit `9467f89` to `origin/feat/control-plane-evolution`.
- **1-Line Zero-Clone Installers**:
  - Upgraded `install.sh` to download pre-built release archives with zero dependencies or build from source using Go fallback.
  - Upgraded `install.ps1` for Windows / PowerShell Core (`pwsh`) with release zip downloads, PATH configuration, and fallback.
  - Updated `README.md` and `README.en.md` highlighting one-line installation (`curl -fsSL ... | bash` and `irm ... | iex`).
  - Pushed commit `bde9084` to `origin/feat/control-plane-evolution`.
- **Visual Harmonization & Full Documentation Review**:
  - Restored top banner (`assets/banner.svg`), `style=for-the-badge` shields, language switcher (`🇧🇷 Português | 🇬🇧 English`), and centered styling across both `README.md` and `README.en.md`.
  - Audited all docs in `docs/` (`account-selection.md`, `usage-and-quota.md`, `provider-development.md`, `security.md`, `ai-cli-control-plane.md`, and `ARCHITECTURE.md`), confirming 100% sanitized examples and accurate architecture specs.
  - Pushed commit `85dfd28` to `origin/feat/control-plane-evolution`.
- **Windows Session Discovery & 5-CLI Detailed Documentation**:
  - Implemented multi-root Windows path normalizer (`filepath.ToSlash`), supporting `%USERPROFILE%`, `%LOCALAPPDATA%`, `%APPDATA%`, and `%HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%`.
  - Added multi-directory session and history resolution in Codex and AGY adapters for Windows native locations (`.codex`, `.gemini/antigravity-cli`).
  - Added dedicated detailed subsections for all 5 supported CLIs (Codex, AGY, Claude Code, OpenCode, Gemini CLI) in `README.md` and `README.en.md`.
  - Pushed commit `008f2f1` to `origin/feat/control-plane-evolution`.

- **AI Control Runtime & Universal Agent Management (Milestones 1-10)**:
  - Baseline audit generated in `DEV/CONTROL_BASELINE_AUDIT.md` from `feat/control-plane-evolution`.
  - Implemented versioned IPC protocol and cross-platform socket/pipe endpoints in `internal/control/protocol`.
  - Implemented persistent runtime registry and lifecycle state engine in `internal/control/registry`.
  - Implemented PTY process coordinator, ring buffer, and universal `/ai` slash command router in `internal/control/host`.
  - Implemented provider control drivers with capability matrix in `internal/control/driver`.
  - Implemented in-memory pub/sub event bus in `internal/control/events`.
  - Implemented safe same-provider account handoff and cross-provider context handoff with secret redaction in `internal/control/handoff`.
  - Created Bubble Tea Control Center TUI in `internal/control/tui`.
  - Integrated `ai control` and `ai ui` CLI commands in `internal/app`.
  - Added deterministic interactive test fixture in `internal/testutil/fakeagent`.
  - Updated `README.md` and `README.en.md` with Section 8 describing Supervised Mode and in-session `/ai` commands.
  - Generated comprehensive implementation report `AI_CONTROL_IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md`.
  - All 40+ tests passing with 0 data races (`go test -race ./...`).

- **Fix: PTY Window Size, Raw Mode and Continuous I/O Streaming**:
  - Implemented `pty.StartWithSize` in `internal/control/host/host.go` capturing live terminal rows and cols (with fallback 80x24).
  - Implemented terminal Raw Mode (`term.MakeRaw`) during `attachRuntime` with graceful `defer term.Restore`.
  - Added OS-agnostic window resize signal routing (`protocol.NotifyWinSizeChange` and `client.Resize`) on SIGWINCH.
  - Replaced line-blocking reader with zero-latency continuous byte-by-byte raw streaming in `SessionHost.streamAttachedInput`.
  - Upgraded dependencies cleanly in `go.mod` (`golang.org/x/term`).
  - Tested with `go test -race ./...` (100% pass).

- **Fix: Socket Deadline Timeout & Non-Duplicated Terminal Input Stream**:
  - Removed 5-second deadline expiration in `protocol.Client.Send` by disabling deadlines (`SetDeadline(time.Time{})`) after RPC frames.
  - Added `ClearDeadline()` and `Reader()` methods to `protocol.Client`.
  - Fixed residual buffer flushing in `attachRuntime` to prevent skipping initial PTY output bytes.
  - Fixed slash command input routing in `SessionHost.processAttachedInput` to prevent duplicate line transmission on Enter.
  - Sockets now stay alive continuously for interactive sessions until explicit detach or process termination.
  - Rebuilt binary in `/home/desenvolvedor/.local/bin/ai`.
  - All tests passing with race detector (`go test -race ./...`).

- **Fix: Precision Slash Interception & Readline Buffer Clearing (`Ctrl+U`)**:
  - Implemented `StripANSI` helper in `internal/control/host/slash_router.go` to sanitize escape sequences and control characters before inspecting slash commands.
  - In `internal/control/host/host.go`, when an `/ai` command is detected on Enter:
    - Sends `\x15` (`Ctrl+U`) to the child process PTY to wipe the line from the CLI's readline buffer.
    - Suppresses the `\r` (Enter) from reaching the child process.
    - Broadcasts the formatted AI Control slash response directly to the user terminal.
  - When `//ai` is detected, clears readline with `Ctrl+U` and sends `/ai <text>\r` to child process.
  - Normal commands pass through directly with `\r`.
  - Rebuilt binary in `/home/desenvolvedor/.local/bin/ai`.
  - Tested with `go test -race ./...` (100% pass).

- **Fix: Stale Process Auto-Purge, Smart Stop & TUI Delete Shortcuts**:

## Date: 2026-08-28
- **AI Control Runtime Hardening & Truth Audit**:
  - Created new hardening branch `feat/ai-control-runtime-hardening` from published baseline `f54833e`.
  - Conducted full subsystem Truth Audit documented in `DEV/AI_CONTROL_TRUTH_AUDIT.md`.
  - **Windows IPC**: Replaced invalid TCP dial of named pipes with native Windows Named Pipe implementation using `github.com/Microsoft/go-winio` (`D:P(A;;GA;;;OW)`) and Unix Domain Sockets under `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` / `/tmp/ai-control-<uid>` with `0600` permissions.
  - **Terminal Backend Abstraction**: Created `internal/control/terminal` defining `Backend` interface with full PTY support on Unix and ConPTY / pipes on Windows.
  - **Truthful Capabilities Framework**: Replaced hardcoded booleans with dynamic `EffectiveCapabilities` containing explicit evidence (`CapabilityStatus`, `Mechanism`, `Reason`, `Tested`). Codex and OpenCode truthfully downgraded to `TERMINAL` mode.
  - **Independent SessionHost Lifecycle**: Implemented hidden background daemon `ai __control-host --runtime <id>` spawned via `Setsid`/`CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP`, allowing supervised runtimes to persist across client detachments.
  - **Transactional Account Handoff**: Refactored `PerformAccountHandoff` into transactional state machine with mandatory session ID check, target provider validation, preflight checks, pre-stop checkpointing, verified session continuity, and automatic rollback (`FAILED_SAFE`).
  - **Context Handoff V2 & Redaction**: Created `WorkCheckpoint` and `LineageRecord` with bounded file limits and comprehensive secret redaction (`OPENAI_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_KEY`, `GOOGLE_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `AWS_KEY`, `JWT`, `PRIVATE_KEY`). Integrated Smart Account Selector when target profile is omitted.
  - **Universal Slash Quota Integration**: Connected `/ai status`, `/ai accounts`, and `/ai usage` to `quota.Engine` and `profile.GetUsageSnapshot`.
  - **CI Platform Matrix**: Updated `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with `ubuntu-latest`, `windows-latest`, and `macos-latest` matrix testing Go 1.22 and Go 1.24 across feature branches.
  - **Documentation & Reports**: Updated `README.md`, `README.en.md`, marked `AI_CONTROL_IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md` as superseded, and generated final hardening report `DEV/AI_CONTROL_HARDENING_REPORT.md`.
  - **Zero Data Races**: All 45+ tests passing with race detector (`go test -race ./...`) and `go vet ./...` clean. Windows cross-compilation verified.


## 2026-08-28: AI Control Full Hardening Execution (All Lanes & Phases)

- **What Changed**:
  - **Lane 1 (Protocol & IPC Security)**:
    - [C-1] Removed silent Named Pipe security fallback in `endpoint_windows.go`.
    - [C-2] Protected Unix socket creation against permission race windows with `syscall.Umask(0177)` and `0600` verification.
    - [C-3] Added ownership verification on `/tmp` socket fallback directory to prevent hijacking.
    - [H-4] Implemented bounded response reading in `protocol.Client` (`readBounded` with 1MB ceiling).
    - [L-1, L-2] Added auto-generated unique request IDs and ticker-based instant context cancellation in `WaitForEndpoint`.
  - **Lane 2 (Registry & Process Lifecycle)**:
    - [H-1] Implemented cross-process file locking for `runtimes.json` using `syscall.Flock` (Unix) and `LockFileEx` (Windows).
    - [H-2] Released registry mutex during network/socket I/O in `CleanupStale` and `PurgeInactive` to eliminate deadlocks.
    - [H-3] Implemented PID recycling validation (`IsProcessAliveWithGeneration`) checking process creation start times against `HostGeneration`.
    - [M-1] Redirected daemon stdout/stderr streams to `<datadir>/logs/<runtime-id>.log`.
    - [H-7] Injected `SIGTERM`/`SIGINT` graceful shutdown traps in `controlHostCmd` and plugged goroutine leaks in `attachRuntime`.
  - **Lane 3 (Handoff, Drivers, Host & TUI)**:
    - [C-4] Reordered `PerformContextHandoff` to verify target runtime is alive before stopping source process (zero session loss).
    - [C-5] Hardened `account.go` rollback to verify source PID liveness before respawning (preventing duplicate processes).
    - [H-5] Added exhaustive integration tests for handoff state transitions, rollback safety, and git bounds.
    - [H-6] Added persistent warning logging for checkpoint and lineage writes.
    - [H-8] Implemented real background handoff execution on intercepted `/ai handoff` and `/ai continue` slash actions.
    - [M-3] Implemented dynamic, capability-aware TUI shortcut rendering (`[h] Handoff` and `[s] Stop`).
    - [M-4] Updated `ARCHITECTURE.md` with complete AI Control Plane section and sequence diagrams.
    - [M-5] Added `BuildKickoffArgs` to `ControlDriver` interface and implemented across all 6 provider drivers.
    - [M-7, L-3, L-4, L-5] Redacted workspace paths, added atomic `.tmp` file writing in checkpoints, cleaned up dead quota init, and removed shadowed `max()` helper.
- **Why**: Production readiness, truthful capabilities, cross-platform security, and zero data-loss resilience across all AI Control operations.
- **Verification**:
  - `go vet ./...` (0 warnings).
  - `go test -race ./...` (100% pass across all packages, 0 data races).
  - Multi-OS build verified (`GOOS=windows`, `GOOS=darwin`, `GOOS=linux`).
  - Binary installed and validated at `/home/desenvolvedor/.local/bin/ai`.

## 2026-08-28: Windows Progress Bar Character Rendering Fix

- **What Changed**:
  - Updated `internal/core/quota/quota.go` (`RenderProgressBar`):
    - On Windows (`runtime.GOOS == "windows"`), replaced UTF-8 block characters `█` (`\u2588`) and `░` (`\u2591`) with standard universal ASCII characters (`#` and `-`, e.g. `[#######---]`), preventing Windows Console / PowerShell / CMD (CP437, CP850, CP1252) from rendering UTF-8 multi-byte sequences as `???` or mojibake.
    - Formatted non-numeric / unknown status states into aligned labels (`[ UNKNOWN  ]`, `[ LIMITED  ]`, `[ UNSUPPORT]`, `[  ERROR   ]`) instead of repeated `?` characters (`[??????????]`), eliminating the appearance of decoding bugs.
  - Updated `internal/tui/tui.go` to use `[ UNKNOWN  ] UNK` fallback instead of `[??????????] UNK`.
  - Updated `internal/core/quota/quota_test.go` and verified with `go test -race ./...`.
## 2026-08-28: Windows Session Resumption Fix (Symlink Privilege Fallback)

- **What Changed**:
  - Implemented `security.SafeLinkOrCopy` in `internal/core/security/link.go`:
    - On Windows, un-elevated non-developer users lack `SeCreateSymbolicLinkPrivilege`. When `os.Symlink` fails, the system automatically falls back to hardlinks (`os.Link`) for files, directory junctions (`mklink /J`) for folders, and recursive copying for cross-volume resources.
  - Updated `internal/core/provider/adapters/codex/codex.go` and `internal/core/provider/adapters/agy/agy.go` to use `SafeLinkOrCopy` and explicitly include the `sessions/` directory in the linked items list.
  - Updated `internal/core/security/isolation.go` to use `SafeLinkOrCopy`.
  - Updated `internal/app/app.go` (`executeResume`) to include clear error context and tips when session resume fails.
- **Why**: Fixes the issue reported on Windows where `ai` failed to resume sessions (`ERROR: No saved session found with ID <id>`) because `CODEX_HOME` did not have access to host sessions due to silent Windows symlink permission failures.
## 2026-08-28: AI Control Runtime Final Validation & Maestro Orchestrated Hardening

- **What Changed**:
  - **Deadlock Elimination**: Fixed re-entrant mutex deadlock in `SessionHost.CmdInput` handling by separating state locks and input handlers.
  - **Zero-Leak Slash Prefix Router**: Implemented `SlashPrefixRouter` state machine in `internal/control/host/slash_prefix.go`, guaranteeing that `/ai <cmd>` never leaks to child provider stdin while streaming normal keystrokes and `//ai` escape without latency.
  - **Bounded Multi-Client Fanout**: Implemented `BoundedFanout` in `internal/control/host/fanout.go` with per-client 256-chunk ring queues and drop policy, preventing slow observers from blocking the terminal writer.
  - **Unified Supervised Launcher**: Created `internal/control/launcher/launcher.go` with `RuntimeLauncher` unifying SessionHost allocation, endpoint discovery, daemon spawning, and handshake verification across `ai control start`, account handoffs, and context continuations.
  - **Mandatory Checkpoint Persistence & Rollback**: Required successful `SaveCheckpoint` before state transitions; verified source process quiescence; enforced safe transactional rollback on target resume failures.
  - **PID Recycling Identity Protection**: Validated start time and host generation in `IsProcessAliveWithGeneration` before executing kill fallbacks in `controlStopCmd` and cleanup routines.
  - **Universal Platform Truth**: Removed hardcoded OS/Arch/Go strings from `ai version` and `ai control doctor`, dynamically reporting `runtime.GOOS`, `runtime.GOARCH`, and `runtime.Version()`. Added provider filtering (`ai control doctor <provider>`).
  - **Adversarial QA Test Suite**: Implemented `internal/control/host/qa_test.go` verifying rapid attach/detach spamming, multi-writer lease handover, and continuous high-throughput streaming.
- **Verification**:
  - `go test -count=1 -race ./...` (44 passed, 0 failed across all packages).
  - `go vet ./...` (0 warnings).
  - Cross-platform compilation: 6 / 6 target platforms (`linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`, `windows/amd64`, `windows/arm64`, `darwin/amd64`, `darwin/arm64`) compiled with exit code 0.
  - Documentation: Created `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-28-ai-control-runtime-validation-design.md`, `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-28-ai-control-runtime-validation.md`, and `AI_CONTROL_FINAL_VALIDATION_REPORT.md`.

## 2026-08-28: AI Control Web Center & Private Remote Control (Subprojects B & C)

- **What Changed**:
  - **Embedded Web Control Center (`ai control web`)**:
    - Created Go HTTP server with dynamic loopback binding (`127.0.0.1:<os-port>`), one-time 256-bit cryptographic bootstrap token exchange, `HttpOnly` `SameSite=Strict` session cookies, and strict CSRF and Origin verification.
    - Integrated React 19 + TypeScript + Lucide + xterm.js SPA compiled with Bun into `web/dist` and embedded directly into the Go binary (`//go:embed all:dist`).
    - Implemented REST API (`/api/v1/workspaces`, `/api/v1/runtimes`, `/api/v1/providers`, `/api/v1/profiles`, `/api/v1/events`) sharing the exact same Control Core without parallel managers.
    - Implemented bidirectional Terminal WebSocket (`/api/v1/runtimes/:id/terminal`) connecting xterm.js to `SessionHost` PTY/ConPTY streams with dynamic window resize forwarding and single-writer lease governance (`CONTROL` vs `VIEW ONLY`).
    - Added UI features: Project sidebar, live runtimes dashboard, multi-terminal tabs, 2x2 split-view grid, Account Handoff modal, and Context Continue modal.
  - **Private Remote Control & Multi-Machine Foundations**:
    - Validated encrypted SSH Port Forwarding Tunnel workflow (`TestRemote_SSHTunnel`) connecting local client browsers to remote host runtimes without exposing public ports.
    - Added private IP range validation (RFC 1918 / CGNAT) and explicit security warning outputs for non-loopback `--listen` bindings.
    - Added `MachineID`, `Location`, and `Transport` fields to `RuntimeSession` with deterministic host identification (`LocalMachineID`).
    - Authored future multi-machine mTLS blueprint in `DEV/AI_CONTROL_REMOTE_NODES_FUTURE.md` and deferred non-goals in `DEV/AI_CONTROL_DEFERRED.md`.
- **Verification**:
  - `go test -count=1 -race ./...` (46 passed, 0 failed across all packages).
  - `go vet ./...` (0 warnings).
  - Cross-platform compilation: 6 / 6 target platforms verified (`linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`, `windows/amd64`, `windows/arm64`, `darwin/amd64`, `darwin/arm64`).
  - Reports generated: `AI_CONTROL_WEB_VALIDATION_REPORT.md`, `AI_CONTROL_REMOTE_VALIDATION_REPORT.md`, and `AI_CONTROL_FINAL_ENGINEERING_REPORT.md`.

## 2026-08-28: Multi-Project Persistence, Session Titles, and Conversation Control

- **What Changed**:
  - **Persistent Multi-Project Store (`internal/control/workspace/workspace.go`)**:
    - Created `workspace.Store` persisting registered repositories to `<datadir>/projects.json`.
    - Added REST endpoints `GET /api/v1/workspaces`, `POST /api/v1/workspaces`, `DELETE /api/v1/workspaces?path=...`.
    - Integrated project manager into Sidebar with inline Add Project form, directory validation, and removal.
  - **Session Title Management**:
    - Added `Title` field to `RuntimeSession`, `LaunchOptions`, and `Registry.UpdateTitle`.
    - Added endpoint `POST /api/v1/runtimes/:id/title` for live title editing.
    - Updated `TerminalPane` with click-to-edit inline pencil input and clean header badges.
    - Updated `TerminalView` tabs to display session title, provider, and profile, eliminating the `● ()` empty badge bug.
  - **Target Project Selection on Launch**:
    - Updated `StartModal` to present a project selector choosing among registered workspaces or entering a custom path.
    - Added optional Session Title input when starting new runtimes.

    - Listed both active and past sessions in `Dashboard.tsx`.
    - Added one-click **Resume** button to offline sessions to continue previous conversations seamlessly.
    - Added native driver for **Cursor Agent** (`cursor-agent` / `agent`) with `--resume` / `--continue` support.
    - Enhanced `runtime.LookPath` with proactive multi-path auto-discovery across NVM, Bun, OpenCode, Cargo, and local bin paths.
- **Verification**:
  - `go test -count=1 -race ./...` (47 passed, 0 failed across all packages).
  - Rebuilt and validated Bun bundle in `web/dist`.
  - Rebuilt and installed binary at `/home/desenvolvedor/.local/bin/ai`.

## 2026-08-28: IAPro-Community Identity & Ecosystem Integration

- **What Changed**:
  - **Web Control Center Branding (`web/`)**:

  - Web SPA rebuilt with Bun into `web/dist` and verified embedded in Go binary.
  - Installed updated binary at `/home/desenvolvedor/.local/bin/ai`.

## 2026-08-28: Fix Raw Resize JSON Stdin Injection into Terminal

- **Root Cause Analysis**:
  - When the browser opened a terminal tab or the pane was resized, `TerminalPane.tsx` sent `{ type: "resize", rows, cols }` over WebSocket to `handler_terminal.go`.
  - `handler_terminal.go` called `client.Resize()` using the *already attached* raw streaming connection.
  - `client.Resize()` sent the JSON RPC request (`{"version":1,"command":"resize",...}\n`) down the attached pipe.
  - Because `SessionHost` had switched that connection to raw streaming (`streamAttachedInput`), it treated the incoming JSON bytes as interactive user typing and wrote the entire JSON string into `sh.termBackend.Write` (the agent's PTY stdin).
- **Fix**:
  - **Out-of-Band Control Channel (`handler_terminal.go` & `control_cmd.go`)**: Window resize events now use a separate short-lived control client (`protocol.NewClient(runtimeID).Resize()`), leaving the attached PTY data stream strictly reserved for user keystrokes.
  - **In-Stream Defense-in-Depth Filter (`host.go`)**: `streamAttachedInput` now checks for incoming `protocol.Request` JSON frames; if detected, it handles the RPC internally without ever writing the JSON into the child process PTY. Suppressed echoing RPC response back to attached stdout for `CmdResize`.
- **Verification**:
  - `go test -race ./...` (47 passed, 0 failed).
  - Rebuilt `/home/desenvolvedor/.local/bin/ai`.

## 2026-08-28: Lane 1 - Web Control Center & Secret Sanitization Hardening (P0.1 & P0.2)

- **WebSocket Authentication & Strict Origin Enforcement (P0.1)**:
  - In `internal/control/web/auth.go` and `internal/control/web/handler_terminal.go`:
    - Hardened `CheckOrigin` and `ValidateOrigin` using `net/url.Parse`.
    - Enforced `http` or `https` scheme, extracted `u.Hostname()` and `u.Port()`.
    - Strictly verified `u.Hostname()` is exactly `"127.0.0.1"`, `"localhost"`, or `"::1"`.
    - Explicitly rejected prefix spoofed domains like `http://localhost.evil.com` and `http://127.0.0.1.attacker.com`.
    - Mandated Origin header presence on WebSocket upgrade requests, rejecting empty origins on WebSockets.
    - Configured Gorilla WebSocket upgrader in `handler_terminal.go` to use the exact same strict `CheckOrigin`.
  - In `internal/control/web/server.go`:
    - Protected the WebSocket terminal route `/api/v1/runtimes/:id/terminal` by validating origin and verifying authentication via `s.auth.AuthenticateRequest(r)` before upgrading, returning HTTP 401 Unauthorized for unauthenticated clients.
    - Enforced authentication across all API routes in `s.authMiddleware` (including GET requests: `/api/v1/runtimes`, `/api/v1/workspaces`, `/api/v1/providers`, `/api/v1/profiles`, `/api/v1/events`), while keeping `/api/v1/health` and `/api/v1/session` public.
- **Secret & Environment Sanitization (P0.2)**:
  - In `internal/control/registry/models.go`:
    - Marked `Binary`, `Args`, and `Env` as `json:"-"` in `RuntimeSession`, ensuring raw process environment variables (`os.Environ()`), execution paths, and command arguments are NEVER written to `runtimes.json` on disk or serialized to JSON.
  - In `internal/control/web/handlers_api.go`:
    - Added `sanitizeSession` defense-in-depth sanitization on all runtime endpoints (`GET /api/v1/runtimes`, `POST /api/v1/runtimes`, `GET /api/v1/runtimes/:id`, handoff, and continue).
    - Updated `writeError` to automatically sanitize error strings through `security.Redact`.
    - Redacted audit event summaries in `handleEvents`.
  - In `internal/core/security/redact.go`:
    - Added database URI password redaction (`postgres://user:pass@host:5432/db`).
    - Expanded GitHub token regex coverage (`gho_`, `ghs_`, `ghu_`, `ghr_`).
    - Handled passwords with special characters and added `RedactSlice`.
- **Testing & Verification**:
  - Added unit test cases for unauthenticated GETs (401), public endpoints (200), and prefix-spoofed Origin rejection (403) in `server_test.go`.
  - Added WebSocket unauthenticated (401), spoofed Origin (403), missing Origin (403), and authenticated upgrade tests in `e2e_test.go`.
  - Added persistence sanitization test in `registry_test.go` verifying disk files and JSON marshaling never contain secrets or env vars.
  - Added URI password, diverse GitHub tokens, and `RedactSlice` tests in `security_test.go`.
  - Verified with `go test -count=1 -race ./internal/control/web/...` and `go test -count=1 -race ./...` (All tests PASS with 0 race warnings).




## Date: 2026-08-28 — Final Production Readiness (branch fix/control-production-readiness)
- Fixed P0 runtime crash: `controlStartCmd` nil-deref when provider has no profiles (scheduler returns non-nil result; guards added). Reproduced live, regression test added.
- Runtime IDs: new `internal/control/ids` ULID package (golden vectors, round-trip, uniqueness, sortability); replaced `UnixNano()%100000` and `len(List())+1` everywhere.
- Workspace IDs: canonical-path + SHA-256 (`ws-…`), distinct for same-basename paths; `List()` sorted by LastUsedAt DESC (deterministic).
- Real Windows ConPTY: `terminal_windows.go` rewritten (CreatePseudoConsole/attribute list/CreateProcessW), truthful pipe fallback, `Backend` gained Wait/Signal/Kill/Mechanism; SessionHost lifecycle moved to backend; windows E2E test authored.
- Protocol: bounded frame reader (no unbounded alloc, fuzz 307k), `ERROR_PROTOCOL_VERSION` enforcement (test).
- Handoff: persistent launcher everywhere (Standalone removed from production paths); ResumeVerifier (no blind session-ID copy) before VERIFIED; ULID lineage/checkpoint IDs.
- Security: CSP/XCTO/Referrer/Permissions/frame-ancestors headers; bind policy — public refused, private requires `--remote`, CGNAT 100.64/10; redaction extended (cookies/auth/quoted-JSON keys) + fuzz 149k.
- Version: `internal/buildinfo` single source; fixed const-vs-ldflags bug; VERSION=0.4.0; GoReleaser ldflags verified on release binary.
- Frontend: TS pinned 5.9.3, ESLint + Vitest added (3 tests), lint issues fixed.
- CI: gofmt gate, windows/macos runtime E2E steps, PowerShell smoke, GoReleaser snapshot job.
- Docs: README sandbox/hermetic terminology corrected to credential isolation; gofmt-clean whole repo.
- Reports: DEV/FINAL_BASELINE_AUDIT.md, FINAL_PRODUCTION_AUDIT.md, FINAL_PLATFORM_MATRIX.md, FINAL_PROVIDER_MATRIX.md, FINAL_SECURITY_REPORT.md, FINAL_RELEASE_REPORT.md, FINAL_10_OF_10_SCORECARD.md.
- Scorecard: 87/100 (8.7/10 CONDITIONAL GO). Blockers: Windows/macOS runtime E2E pending CI + local; session expiry/rotation; doctor v2; final independent review.

## Date: 2026-08-28 — Nexus V1 Gate 1 (feat/nexus-v1)
- SQLite durable product state (modernc.org/sqlite, pure Go): internal/nexus/store + embedded idempotent migrations (projects/agents/revisions/generations/lineage/layouts/events/maestro/verification).

**Objective**: Fix Maestro degraded state (`maestro binary not found`) permanently, ensure dependency is checked/installed in `install.sh` / `install.ps1`, update Go bridge in `internal/nexus/maestro.go`, and add Maestro status to `nexus doctor`.

### Changes Applied
1. `internal/nexus/maestro.go`:
   - Updated binary detection to locate `orquestrador-maestro`, `maestro`, and `orquestrador` across PATH and standard Node/system directories.
   - Added dynamic capability loader querying version and providing active skills catalog (`skill-saas-factory`, `skill-security-hooks`, `skill-tdd`, `skill-dev-hierarchy`).
   - Implemented advice bridge linking Orquestrador Maestro protocol rules & context briefing for active project guidance.
2. `install.sh` & `install.ps1`:
   - Automatically check for `@iapro/orquestrador-maestro-cli` and install via npm if missing.
   - Create symlinks/aliases (`maestro` and `orquestrador`) in the target binary directory (`~/.local/bin`).
3. `internal/app/app.go`:
   - Added Orquestrador Maestro status report to `nexus doctor` / `ai doctor`.

### Verification
- `go test ./...`: ALL PASS
- `nexus doctor`: Reports `Maestro status: AVAILABLE (v0.1.22, mode: ASSIST)`
- `/api/v1/maestro` & `/api/v1/maestro/advice`: Returns HTTP 200 with structured recommendations

## 2026-08-29 — Auto-Update System for IAPro Nexus & Orquestrador Maestro

**Objective**: Guarantee that IAPro Nexus and Orquestrador Maestro are self-updating and always maintained in sync.

### Changes Applied
1. `internal/app/update.go` & `internal/app/app.go`:
   - Implemented `nexus update` / `ai update` CLI command that checks and pulls `@iapro/orquestrador-maestro-cli@latest`, runs skills sync (`orquestrador-maestro update --non-interactive`), and updates the Nexus binary and symlinks.
2. `internal/control/web/handlers_nexus.go` & `server.go`:
   - Added REST endpoints `GET /api/v1/system/updates` and `POST /api/v1/system/update`.
3. `web/src/features/settings/SettingsSurface.tsx` & `web/src/nexus/api.ts`:
   - Added **Updates & Maintenance** card in the Settings view with real-time version status and a **"Update Nexus & Maestro"** action.

### Verification
- `nexus update`: Successfully upgraded Orquestrador Maestro to `0.1.25` and synchronized skills.
- `nexus doctor`: Reports `Maestro status: AVAILABLE (v0.1.25, mode: ASSIST)`.
- `go test ./...`: All 37 packages passing cleanly.
- Frontend test suite: 9 files / 36 tests passing.

## 2026-08-29 — Web UI Update Notification System

**Objective**: Notify users in real-time in the Web UI whenever new updates for Nexus or Orquestrador Maestro are available.

### Changes Applied
1. `internal/control/web/handlers_nexus.go`:
   - Updated `handleSystemUpdates` to query the npm registry for the latest `@iapro/orquestrador-maestro-cli` release and report `update_available: true/false`.
2. `web/src/nexus/api.ts`:
   - Added update response types with `update_available` flag.
3. `web/src/app/NexusShell.tsx` & `web/src/app/workspace-os.css`:
   - Added animated badge button `[Update available]` in the topbar status area.
   - Clicking the badge takes the user directly to the Settings surface to perform the 1-click update.

### Verification
- `go test ./...`: ALL PASS
- `web vitest`: ALL 36 TESTS PASS

## 2026-08-29 — Resolution of 7 Pending Issues

**Objective**: resolve all 7 pending issues with business rules in the backend only, ensuring TUI and Web share the same logic.

### Changes Applied

#### Issue #1: Resources facade → Real Discovery
- Created `internal/nexus/resource_discovery.go` with `ListResources()`, `AllocateResource()`, `ResolveStartParams()`.
- `handleResourcesList` now calls real discovery via `profile.List()` + `driver.Detect()`.
- `handleResourceSelect` validates and persists selection to `AgentConfig`.

#### Issue #2: Maestro synthetic state → Honest degradation
- `queryCapabilities()` returns error when `capabilities --json` fails (removed hardcoded skills/gates/processes).
- `GetAdvice()` returns `Mode: MaestroOff` with empty recommendation lists (removed hardcoded recommendations).

#### Issue #3: Update simulated → 501 Not Implemented
- `handleSystemUpdate` returns `501 Not Implemented` instead of fake success.

#### Issue #4: Agent start without provider → Resource selection flow
- `handleAgentStart` calls `ResolveStartParams()` before `StartAgent`.
- Returns `409 REQUIRED_RESOURCE_SELECTION` when no provider configured.
- UI opens `ResourcePicker` modal for selection.

#### Issue #5: Config not reaching runtime → Full propagation
- `LaunchOptions` extended with `Model`, `Environment`, `Isolation`, `Options`.
- `StartAgent` reads full `AgentConfig` and passes all fields to launcher.
- Environment variables injected into runtime process.

#### Issue #6: Terminal continuity → AgentTerminalBroker integration
- `HandleWebSocket` now accepts `agentID`, registers with broker.
- `NotifyRuntimeChanged()` emits `runtime_changed` frames to browsers.
- `WatchRuntimeChanged()` goroutine closes WebSocket on generation switch.
- Added `ResolveAgentByRuntimeID()` for reverse lookup.

#### Issue #7: Missions scaffold → Kept as-is
- CRUD functional, no execution/orchestration. Documented as future work.

## 2026-08-29 — Agent-bound Resource Allocation

**Objective**: make provider/profile selection operational and durable before an Agent starts.

### Changes Applied
1. Resource discovery now distinguishes an installed provider binary from an authenticated profile.
2. `POST /api/v1/resources/select` requires an Agent, provider, and profile; it validates the exact account and persists the choice as the Agent's configuration revision.
3. Agent start accepts only the persisted resource, preventing an ephemeral provider/profile override.
4. The Agents surface opens Resource selection when an Agent has no allocation, then starts it after a successful allocation.

### Verification
- `go test ./...`: ALL PASS
- `web/node_modules/.bin/tsc --noEmit -p web/tsconfig.json`: PASS
- `web/node_modules/.bin/vitest run`: 10 files / 44 tests PASS

## 2026-08-29 — Nexus V1 Autopilot Completion (Phases A through J)

**Objective**: Complete the full Nexus architecture: Foundation Corrections, Resource Recommendation, Nexus Intelligence, Structured WorkPlans, Visual Plan Builder, Durable Autonomous Mission Runner, and Web-First CLI experience.

### Key Deliverables & Architectural Modules
1. **Foundation Corrections (Phase A)**:
   - Reconciled live effective agent state in `GET /api/v1/projects/:id/agents` and detail endpoints.
   - Agent recovery reconstructs launch state strictly from Project Canonical Path, AgentConfigRevision (model, options, env, isolation).
   - Implemented transactional SafeApply with `ReconfigureTransaction` semantics (creates single revision, stops old runtime gracefully, switches generation atomically, auto-rollbacks on launch error).
   - Unified single-writer lease authority in `AgentTerminalBroker` tied to stable `AgentID`.
   - Hardened network security (refuses `0.0.0.0`/`::` wildcard binds, enforces loopback or explicit private IP, origin checking, 24h session expiry with 4h idle timeout, session revocation/rotation).
   - Added Git branch safety policy blocking checkouts when agents are active in the canonical workspace.
2. **Resource Recommendation Service (Phase B)**:
   - Implemented `internal/nexus/resource_recommendation.go` with multi-criteria scoring (`BALANCED`, `PRESERVE_QUOTA`, `PREFER_PROVIDER`, `MANUAL`).
   - Exposed `POST /api/v1/resources/recommend`.
3. **Nexus Intelligence Layer (Phase C)**:
   - Implemented `internal/nexus/intelligence/` (`OpenAIIntelligenceProvider`, `NexusEngine`, heuristic fallbacks).
   - Structured ambiguity evaluation (`BLOCKING`, `IMPORTANT`, `LOW_IMPACT`) and deterministic prompt compilation.
4. **Structured WorkPlans & Prompt Compilation (Phase D)**:
   - Added SQLite migration `0003_workplans.sql` and `internal/nexus/store/plans.go` (`WorkPlan`, `PlanPhase`, `WorkPackage`, `PlanRevision`, `ExecutionSnapshot`).
   - Added plan CRUD, revision history, and package prompt compilation in `internal/nexus/plan.go`.
5. **Visual Plan Builder Surface (Phase E)**:
   - Implemented `web/src/features/work/PlanBuilderSurface.tsx` with AI intent decomposer, visual phase/package hierarchy, and live prompt compiler preview.
   - Integrated into `WorkSurface.tsx` under Planned mode.
6. **Durable Autonomous Mission Runner (Phase F & H)**:
   - Implemented `internal/nexus/runner/` (`MissionRunner`, `AutonomyContract`, `RetryController`, `VerificationEngine`, `LeaseManager`).
   - State machine: `READY -> ALLOCATE -> COMPILE -> EXECUTE -> TESTING -> REVIEWING -> VERIFIED -> COMPLETED`.
7. **Web-First CLI Product Experience (Phase I)**:
   - Default `nexus` and `ai` launch Web Workspace OS automatically.
   - Added non-interactive CLI commands: `nexus plan`, `nexus agents`, `nexus projects`, `nexus open`.
8. **Documentation & Release Gates (Phase J)**:
   - Generated `DEV/NEXUS_V1_AUTONOMY_REPORT.md`, `DEV/NEXUS_V1_INTELLIGENCE_REPORT.md`, `DEV/NEXUS_V1_SCHEDULER_REPORT.md`, `DEV/NEXUS_V1_SECURITY_REPORT.md`, `DEV/NEXUS_V1_RELEASE_NOTES.md`, `DEV/NEXUS_V1_USER_GUIDE.md`.

### Verification Evidence
- `go test -race ./...`: 100% ALL PASS (0 race conditions).
- `npx tsc --noEmit`: 0 errors.
- `npx eslint .`: 0 errors, 0 warnings.
- `bun run build`: Web bundle compiled in ~180ms.
- `make build`: Nexus binary `v0.5.0-beta.4` compiled and installed.

## 2026-08-29 — Maximum Delivery blocks 1–5 + deep review

- Closed Mission Runner/durability/Take Control/WorkPlan/E2E contract gaps on `feat/nexus-maximum-delivery`.
- Added durable execution evidence, lease concurrency hardening, WorkPlan DAG/revision protection, session rotation/logout, project Mission routing and real-provider local E2E harness.
- Revalidated frontend: 22 files / 76 tests, TypeScript, ESLint and build PASS in sandbox.
- Deep review verdict: `CONDITIONAL_GO` candidate. Production `GO` remains gated by Go 1.25 full vet/test/race, real SQLite/WebSocket dependencies, physical Windows/macOS runtime and a real authenticated-provider smoke.
- See `DEV/NEXUS_MAXIMUM_DELIVERY_*.md` for evidence and release conditions.
# 2026-08-30 — Final production pass

- Change: captured source baseline; fixed stdout capture deadlock in the app test harness; implemented WorkspaceModel v2 with focused stack, semantic `logicalKey`/`viewId`, v1 migration, project-scoped v2 storage and hydration-gated persistence; changed UI split to create an empty pane; added strict terminal frame parsing and regressions.
- Why: source still declared Workspace v1 and control output capture could block on a full pipe; terminal JSON fallback could leak control frames or drop legitimate provider JSON.
- Verification: focused Go tests, full `go vet`, `go test -count=1 ./...`, `go test -race ./...`, build, Windows/macOS focused cross-compiles, frozen Bun install, frontend typecheck/lint/94 tests/build, focused security race tests, `git diff --check`; all passed. `diff -qr web/dist internal/control/web/dist` is the embedded sync check.
- Next: run native Windows/macOS CI and real-provider/browser/automation E2E; install or execute release/security tools; review and authorize commit/push if desired.

## 2026-08-30 — Proxy-nginx attention prompt fix

- Reproduced from the authenticated frontend screenshot: the global attention banner was inserted as a layout row above the Workspace and the AGY response action used a short-lived RPC connection that the host rejected because the browser lease belonged to another connection.
- Fixed external runtime responses, reset stale attention-detector prompt history after accepted input, cleared the published attention state, and changed the banner to a non-layout-blocking floating surface.
- Verification: focused host/web tests PASS; host `-race` PASS; frontend typecheck/lint/94 tests/build PASS; embedded bundle rebuilt; `git diff --check` PASS. No commit or push performed.
