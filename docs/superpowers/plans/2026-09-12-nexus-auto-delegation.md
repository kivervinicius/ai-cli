# Implementation plan — Nexus automatic delegation

Base: `37b9ddec49ce72d869bbeb2ad402a1d4dd2bc674`

1. Add the source-agnostic `DelegationMode`, `DelegationDecision` and
   `DelegatedWorkstream` contract, persisted in existing WorkPlan facts.
2. Apply deterministic dispatch-brake heuristics before Flow expansion and
   project independent backend/frontend/QA steps with ownership and DAG
   dependencies; keep simple goals direct.
3. Route every delegated package through the existing `MatchAgents` and
   `ResourceScheduler` path; enrich only auto-created persistent Agents with a
   revisioned `AgentSpec`.
4. Carry the lead identity in the existing MissionRun envelope and expose the
   persisted delegation decision in the existing routing report.
5. Verify focused tests, the Nexus package suite, race/vet/full repository
   gates, and review the diff for duplicate schedulers or provider-bound Agent
   identities.
